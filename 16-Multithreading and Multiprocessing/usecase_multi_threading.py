Real-World Example: Multithreading For I/O-bound Tasks
Scenario: Web Scrapping
Web Scraping often involves making numerous network requests to
fetch web pages. These Tasks are I/O-bound because they spend a lot of
time waiting for responses from servers. Multithreading can significantly
improve the performance by allowing multiple webpages to be fetched concurrently.
